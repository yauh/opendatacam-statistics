# opendatacam-statistics
 Simple statistics from OpenDataCam using R

## Input Data
As a prerequisite, counter data generated by [OpenDataCam]() is expected to be placed inside the `/input` folder. It can be either in the `csv` or `json` format. We'll ignore `json` for now.

### CSV format

The column structure in the `csv` file is

| Position in csv | Fieldname | Allowed values |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 | frameId | int |
| 2 | Timestamp |  |
| 3 | Counter ID | Name assigned to the counter (e.g. "grenze") |
| 4 | name | class of the object (e.g. "car", "truck", "person") |
| 5 | bearing | [0-360] Direction where the object is heading (in degree, ex: 0 degree means heading toward top of the frame, 180 towards bottom) |
| 6 | Direction | "bidirectional", "leftright_topbottom", "rightleft_bottomtop" |
| 7 | angleWithCountingLine | [0-360] |

Sample in `csv`:
```
1133,"2021-12-05T13:45:25.245Z","grenze","car",73,90.97102193107916,"rightleft_bottomtop",88.17329797295241
```
For reference, this is how it looks as `json`:

```json
{
  "frameId":1133,
  "timestamp":"2021-12-05T13:45:25.245Z",
  "area":"d920cd61-23bf-4b92-9d85-dd247297bb3d",
  "name":"car",
  "id":73,
  "bearing":90.97102193107916,
  "countingDirection":"rightleft_bottomtop",
  "angleWithCountingLine":88.17329797295241
}
```
